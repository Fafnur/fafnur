Senior Front-end Developer, Angular evangelist, Nx apologist, NodeJS warlock

I'm a frontend developer with 7 years of experience specializing in creating beautiful user interfaces with Angular. My technical stack
includes JavaScript, TypeScript, Redux, Git, and a monorepo approach.

Throughout my career, I've developed enterprise applications for the fintech industry, working on projects that have delivered significant
value to my clients. I take pride in my ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software
solutions.

In addition to my work, I also write articles about Angular on Medium, sharing my knowledge and insights with the wider development
community.

I believe in the importance of continuously learning and improving, and I'm always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to expand
my skill set.
